Agenda for class.


Prelim questions
================

Any additions to the agenda?


Projects!
---------

I have the sense that most folks are starting to find traction.


Topics
======

Meta Programming
----------------

I think I did a crappy job of talking about getattr/setattr, because I never disceted their call signatures.

...and noboday asked me any questions.  Ahem.

Meta-mailroom -- How's it going?

Code, code, whose got some code?


Logging & Debugging
-------------------

If you can't find resources and files referenced in the material, check my directory in the repo.

Testing
-------

Unittest

Nose

Pytest

Mocks

Joe's example involves depencency injection... what's that?

Shall we look at some real code?

Missing rescources?  Ditto, see my folder in the repo.


Exercises
---------

Let's read through them together.


Random
------

I forgot my wallet today... and need to take a ferry after class tonight.

Could I borrow $10 from someone?

(fer real, no joke)
