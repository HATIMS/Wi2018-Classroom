"""
Your job, now, is to:

* get artists
* get song names for for tracks
with:
* danceability scores over 0.8
* and loudness scores below -5.0.

In other words, quiet yet danceable tracks.

Also, these

* tracks should be sorted in descending order by danceability
    so that the
* most danceable tracks are up top.

You should be able to

* work your way there starting with the comprehension above.

And while you could use Pandas features along the way, you donâ€™t need to.
To accomplish the objective you do not need to know anything more about Pandas than what
you can infer from the material herein. Standard library functions that could come in handy
include

* can use: zip() and sorted().

Submit your code and the top five tracks to complete the assignment.
